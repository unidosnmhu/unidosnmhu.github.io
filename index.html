                    <p>

                        Distance education is also known as “distance learning” or “e-learning”, and is offered different than the traditional classroom setting.  In this type of instruction, a student and teacher are physically apart from each other.  They are virtually connected via software programs that are designed to send/receive instruction via the internet.  Professors normally transmit information digitally to students via personal computers, tablets or in some cases on their smart phones.  Professors may also require students to access a web link on the university website for assignments and relative educational materials.

                    <p><span><b>WHAT BENEFITS ARE THERE TOWARDS PURSUIT OF EDUCATION VIA DISTANCE?</b></span></p>

                    <p>
                        Taking distance education courses or pursuing a program via distance education offers flexibility for individuals that are busy, are working, or have a family to take care of and support.  Pursuit of distance education is also beneficial for individuals that are looking to grow their career, parents that seek to better provide for their families, and individuals that are ready to return to school and continue where they previously left off. Following are reasons that you might consider why online learning is attractive:

                            <p>Online education offers flexibility for students who have other commitments. Whether you're a busy stay-at-home parent or a professional that simply doesn't have the time to take a course during school hours, you can find online courses and programs that fit your schedule. One of the benefits of online learning is that you don’t have to get dressed, get in the car, fight traffic, commute to campus and attend class.  The Conectado student survey further indicated that 73% of students cited convenience, flexibility and accessibility from home were positive features of online education.</p>

                            Synchronous learning is when classes occur on set schedules and time frames. Students and instructors are online at the same time in synchronous classes since lectures, discussions, and presentations take place on specific days. All students must be online at that exact time in order to participate in the class.

                            Asynchronous classes are predetermined and recorded. Students are given a timeframe – it's usually a one-week window – to connect to their class as often as they would like. The good news is that in asynchronous courses, you could hit the books no matter what hour of day (or night).

                        Blended Instruction (hybrid) are a combination of asynchronous or synchronous courses.  The university uses Desire2Learn which is a learning management system used by faculty and instructional staff to enhance face-to-face instruction (synchronous courses) or teach courses totally online (asynchronous). D2L allows “anytime, anywhere” access to course related files, electronic drop boxes for assignments, online quizzes and tests, email, and grades.

                        Online and hybrid (combination of online and in-class) courses demand more time management skills, more discipline, and more dedication on your part in order to successfully complete them. Not all courses can be taken via your phone, iPad or Notebook.

                    Online and hybrid courses can take more time than traditional in-class courses.They demand more time management skills, more discipline, and more self-motivation on your part in order to successfully complete them. Not all courses can be taken via your phone, ipad or Notebook.

                <p class="mt-10 mb-10">
                    In order to succeed, a student needs to align their online course(s) with personal life activities plus manage family and work obligations.  Relative influences towards consideration of knowing that you are ready for pursuit of education via distance education are to be mature, motivated, organized and be self-directed.
